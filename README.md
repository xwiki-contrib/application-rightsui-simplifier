# Rights UI Simplifier
A more user friendly application for managing rights to groups.
It offers another ui on top of the default one which offers the possibility of using a dropdown list for setting right in favour of the old checkbox system. Although it has fewer options, if the need appears for setting some advanced combination of rights, you can still access the old ui by clicking the "Go to advanced" link on the top right.
